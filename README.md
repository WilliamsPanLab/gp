This is the main page hosting the code repository and replication guide for "The relationship between cognition and psychopathology depends". For clarity, analyses and replication guides are broken up into 4 sections. In the spirit of useful reductionism, general cognition is referred to as *g* throughout, and general psychopathology is referred to as *p* throughout. 

[Step 1](https://github.com/WilliamsPanLab/gp/tree/master/Step1_SampleConstruction) is sample construction. This step takes NDAR resources, formats them, checks/omits missing data, produces some derivative-measures (g, parent P). Supplementary analyses include establishing functional equivalence of the metrics we use with that obtained in prior literature.

[Step 2](https://github.com/WilliamsPanLab/gp/tree/master/Step2_Fig1) corresponds to figure 1, and executes bootstrap iterations to reveal the linear and non-linear relationship between *g* and *p*, as well as more granular psychopathology scores. 

Step 3 corresponds to figure 2, and executes bootstraps to reveal interactions with sex and poverty in *g*~*p*

Step 4 corresponds to figure 3, and executes bootstraps to reveal the relationship and relative relationship of parental mental health to child *g*
