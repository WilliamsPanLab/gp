This is the main page hosting the code repository and replication guide for "The relationship between psychiatric symptoms and cognition depends on symptom severity". For clarity, analyses and replication guides are broken up into 3 sections. In the spirit of useful reductionism, general cognition is referred to as *g* throughout, and general psychopathology is referred to as *p* throughout. 

For each step, a detailed walk-through is linked.

[Step 1](https://github.com/WilliamsPanLab/gp/tree/master/Step1_SampleConstruction) is sample construction. This step takes NDAR resources, formats them, checks/omits missing data, produces some derivative-measures (g, parent P). Supplementary analyses include establishing functional equivalence of the metrics we use with that obtained in prior literature.

[Step 2](https://github.com/WilliamsPanLab/gp/tree/master/Step2_Fig1) corresponds to figure 1, and executes bootstrap iterations to reveal the linear and non-linear relationship between *g* and *p*, as well as more granular psychopathology scores. 

[Step 3](https://github.com/WilliamsPanLab/gp/tree/master/Step3_Fig2) corresponds to figure 2, and executes bootstraps to interrogate parental mental health measures alongside poverty interactions. 

Many thanks to the ABCD families and study teams.
